# We have a winner!

![](/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/legends-300x185.jpg "legends of good women")Congratulations to Tonya Howe, the winner of our Juxta Commons sharing competition, leading up to the MLA Conference in Boston (#MLA13). Be sure to have a look at the side-by-side view of her comparison set, [Legend of Good Women, Prologues A and B](http://www.juxtacommons.org/shares/0Y837u).

Weâ€™ll be featuring the set in the Juxta Commons gallery in the very near future, along with some of the other sets that received lots of interest in the last month.
