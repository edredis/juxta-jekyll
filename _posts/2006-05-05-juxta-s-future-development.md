# Juxta’s Future Development

Juxta is being released under an Educational Community License. We will be making it available in SourceForge very shortly, and we welcome all and any suggestions about its future development. It’s the case that, as currently released, Juxta’s interface has a kind of “black-box” appearance. We wanted it to be as user-friendly as possible and in that effort we left developers without easy access to the code. Ron Van den Branden’s comment (on our initial post, below) has spurred us to decide that we should, as soon as possible, release a “developer’s pack” with information about how jxt and source XML files are located and constructed, and maybe with some sample XSLT for TEI-lite. On that matter look for a posting shortly, within a couple of weeks.

As to the other issue raised by Ron’s feedback: at present Juxta outputs HTML and so doesn’t facilitate XSL transformations for databases and online editions. But the tool was conceived for XML output (it’s built using the Velocity template engine) and this development is planned (in the next release of Juxta, this year).
