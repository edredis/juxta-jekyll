# Beta-release of Juxta includes online sharing

[Calling all beta testers!](http://juxta.performantsoftware.com/)

Over the past few months, NINES and the developers of Juxta have been busy adapting the application for use on the web. In order to expand our testing capabilities, weâ€™re releasing a version of the desktop client that offers users the ability to share comparison sets online.

If you have any sets of witnesses to a particular work that you would like to collate and share, we invite you to sign up and [download the beta version](http://juxta.performantsoftware.com/) to try out some of our online features. Please keep in mind that this is a trial version of the web-service, and may be subject to changes and updates over the next few months. Joining us now ensures that your feedback will make the full release of the software better than we could manage in-house.
