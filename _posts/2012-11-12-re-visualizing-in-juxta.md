# Re-visualizing in Juxta: [Newsdiffs.org](http://newsdiffs.org/)

The Juxta R&D team recently did a demo of [Juxta Commons](http://juxtacommons.org/) at a DH Day conference at NC State University, and one of the attendees brought the site[NewsDiffs.org](http://www.newsdiffs.org/) to our attention. It’s a great resource, [tracking changes](http://www.newsdiffs.org/about/) to online, “published” articles from some of the largest media outlets out there. But, while NewsDiffs brings together a bunch of different versions of these online articles, their visualizations are only helpful for two versions at a time.

As an experiment, I took several versions from [this example](http://www.newsdiffs.org/diffview/?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html&v1=b310c14531be3e77a259c3496e4e32b5a9430899&v2=11648400c245d21851bd1388ad1f01623a546712&pagewanted=all) and plugged them into Juxta Commons. When combined in the heat map, the results were truly surprising.

In this example, the newest version (captured on November 6, 2012) is the base witness, with the previous revisions made on the day of the articles release included in the set. Just imagine: readers visiting the New York Times article at 11:15am would have read a very different set of opening paragraphs than those checking in at 11:45am.
