# Using Juxta in the Classroom: Scholar’s Lab Presentation

Director of NINES Andrew Stauffer and Project Manager Dana Wheeles will be joining the UVa [Scholar’s Lab](http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/) today to discuss Juxta Commons and possible uses for the software in the classroom. Below are a list of sets included in the demo to illustrate the numerous ways Juxta could draw students’ attention to textual analysis and digital humanities.

**Traditional Scholarly Sets for Analysis and Research**

* [Alice in Wonderland](http://www.juxtacommons.org/shares/GJm4O9)
* [D.G. Rossetti, The Stealthy School of Criticism](http://www.juxtacommons.org/shares/FF0x40)
* [Inflammatory Reactions](http://www.juxtacommons.org/shares/0S6Jlx), by Andrew Stauffer
* Mary Shelley’s [Frankenstein](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/Nme50n)

**Scholarly Sets for Classroom Engagement**

* [Hamlet, Quarto 4](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/rOb8vn) – Showing variants in spelling, and questioning “_What is a work_?”
* [The Declaration of Independence](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/yY6Wrj) – The evolution of a familiar document
* [Tennyson’s The Princess](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/ym0F00) – Authenticating texts on the web

**Beyond traditional scholarship: born-digital texts**

* Wikipedia: [Climate Change](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/OGR57q) – Seemingly stable documents mask constant debate between contributors and editors
* Current Events: [New York Times on Health Care](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/ZHOLOJ) (via [Newsdiffs.org](http://newsdiffs.org/))
* [Instagram Terms of Service](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/MItAtV) – How contracts evolve

**Our favorites from the user community**

* [PC Fleming](http://www.pcfleming.com/2013/02/26/wikipedia-the-oscars-and-juxta/) tracks the [Daniel Day-Lewis](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/AWKXmV) wikipedia page during the Oscars
* George H. Williams compares two modern translations of [Sir Gawain and the Green Knight](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/FqQnTH)
* Tonya Howe compares two versions of a fourteenth-century poem, [Legend of Good Women](http://juxtacommons.org/shares/EsxOZ7)
