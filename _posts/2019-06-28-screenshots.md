# Screenshots

Juxta comes with several kinds of analytic visualizations. The primary collation gives a split frame comparison of a base text with a witness text, along with a display of the digital images from which the base text is derived. Click on a screenshot below to see samples:

Double clicking on files with a “txt” or “xml” extension opens them in a preview mode.

Clicking on the file icon allows the scholar to select a directory from which to select files for collation.

The scholar can then choose to import the entire file into the collation or to highlight a fragment and pull just the highlighted fragment into the collation.

Juxta comes with several kinds of analytic visualizations. The primary collation gives a split frame comparison of a base text with a witness text, along with a display of the digital images from which the base text is derived. Juxta displays a heat map of all textual variants and allows the user to locate — at the level of any textual unit — all witness variations from the base text. A histogram of Juxta collations is particularly useful for long documents. This visualization displays the density of all variation from the base text and serves as a useful finding aid for specific variants. Juxta can also output a lemmatized schedule (in HTML format) of the textual variants in any set of comparisons.
