**Juxta Commons is the newly-released destination site for using Juxta on the web.**

Powered by the [Juxta Web Service](https://github.com/performant-software/juxta-service/wiki), Juxta Commons offers users the option of uploading files, linking to them on the web, or creating them in its very own text editor. The [visualizations](http://juxtacommons.org/guide#visualizations) that were made popular by the desktop client have been translated for use in a browser, and optimized for sharing.
