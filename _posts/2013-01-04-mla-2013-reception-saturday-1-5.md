For all those attending the Modern Languages Association Conference in Boston this year, please join NINES Directory Andrew Stauffer and Performant Software for a reception in the exhibit hall (Booth 717) on Saturday, January 5. Weâ€™ll be running demos of Juxta Commons and answering your questions about NINES, Juxta and digital humanities software in general.
