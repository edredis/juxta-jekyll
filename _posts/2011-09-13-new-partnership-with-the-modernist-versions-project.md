Great news! Juxta is at the center of a new partnership agreement between [NINES](http://www.nines.org/)and the Modernist Versions Project (MVP). The agreement provides the MVP with programming support to integrate Juxta with a digital environment for collating and comparing modernist texts that exist in multiple textual variants. The MVP, a project based at the [University of Victoria](http://www.uvic.ca/), will enjoy full access to the Juxta collation software, including the existing [stand-alone application](http://dev-juxtasoftware.pantheonsite.io/download.html) and the web service [now under development](http://code.google.com/p/juxta/wiki/ProjectRoadmap). The MVP is expected to provide a robust environment for testing and enhancing both versions of Juxta.
