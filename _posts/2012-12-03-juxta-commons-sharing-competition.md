**Updated with more details about the competition**

[Juxta Commons](http://juxtacommons.org/) users – share your favorite comparison set today, and the set with the most views in the next month wins the user free swag!

Create and share a collation set and get the MOST UNIQUE VIEWS in one month. You’ll win a lovely Juxta Commons commuter coffee mug, plus fame and glory. We will be keeping track via analytics, and we will announce the winner in early January.

You can share your visualizations by Twitter, Facebook, Google +, link, email and embed, so there are lots of ways to get the word out.

Remember that we are still in beta and are particularly interested in load-testing the site, so bear with us if you experience slow-downs. You can send us feedback and bug reports via our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/juxta-dev) and you can find information about using the site on our [User Guide](http://www.juxtacommons.org/guide).

The winner will be announced at our presentation at MLA. Happy collating!
