The NINES R&D team is happy to announce a new phase of testing for Juxta online: Juxta Commons. We’re entering our final phase of intensive testing on this new site for using Juxta on the web, which breaks down the processes of the desktop application so you always have access to your raw source files and your witnesses, in addition to your comparison sets. We’ve even added more ways to work with XML, as well as an option to import and export files encoded in [TEI Parallel Segmentation](http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html).

We have invited a group of scholars and users to try out Juxta Commons for the next two months, and share their experiences online. They’ll be exploring new ways to add source files, filter XML content and browse our newly-updated visualizations, previewed in the gallery above.

If you would like to be a part of this group of testers, please leave a comment below, and we’ll get in touch with you.
